Summary: My current plans for creating plugins for Mendeley, Figshare et al.

Apart from the addition of new features such as Python 3 support and archiving functionality it also fixed minor bugs and improved overall reliability. Furthermore, the plugins that were shipped with the canonical version of Pelican are now maintained in a separate repository, which hopefully will encourage the community (including myself) to develop additional modular plugins to extend Pelican's current functionality. I myself am particularly interested in writing plugins for Mendeley, Figshare and ORCID which can be accessed via APIs.
